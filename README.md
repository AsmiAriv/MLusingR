# MLusingR

## You need to read PDF files under each folder for instructions

##You can use the  data files (.mat files) from ML3 for the script in ML4. Just change the file names accordingly.

##For all the algorithm (ML1,ML2,...etc.),
first open ex.R files (ex1.R, ex1_multi.R,ex2.R, ex2_reg.R,.....etc.), to step you through the entire algorithm

##I had taken up Machine Learning Course by Stanford on Coursera
##All the codes were written in MATLAB, as per the requirement of the course
##Having finished the course successfully, I though of converting the entire matlab codes into R codes
##That's what I have done here. 

##I am still working on the others (4 more to go)
